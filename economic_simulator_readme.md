# Economic History Simulator üèõÔ∏è

An interactive web-based educational tool that allows users to experience major economic events from the 20th and 21st centuries, understand policy implications, and experiment with different economic scenarios in real-time.

## Overview

This simulator brings economic theory to life by allowing users to step into the shoes of economic policymakers during critical historical moments. From the Roaring Twenties to modern AI-driven workplace transformation, users can adjust policy levers and see immediate economic consequences based on established economic principles.

## Features

2. Select an era/scenario from the navigation buttons
3. Adjust policy controls using sliders and buttons
4. Observe real-time changes in economic indicators
5. Read the educational explanations to understand the theory

### Scenario Walkthrough

#### 1920s Economic Boom
- **Goal**: Understand how post-WWI policies created prosperity and bubbles
- **Controls**: Tax rates (25-75%), Money supply growth (0-100%), Interest rate policy
- **Key Learning**: Low taxes + easy money = growth + asset bubbles

#### Great Depression
- **Goal**: Test different crisis responses (minimal, New Deal, massive stimulus)
- **Controls**: Government spending, Trade policy (Smoot-Hawley vs. free trade), Banking policy
- **Key Learning**: Trade protection backfired; financial system support was crucial

#### Phillips Curve
- **Goal**: Explore inflation-unemployment trade-offs
- **Controls**: Expected inflation, Actual inflation target, Supply shocks
- **Key Learning**: Short-run trade-offs disappear when expectations adjust

#### Fiscal Policy Lab
- **Goal**: Act as government economic advisor
- **Controls**: Government spending (-$100B to +$200B), Tax policy, Exchange rate regime
- **Key Learning**: Multiplier effects, crowding-out, timing problems

#### Central Bank Governor
- **Goal**: Use Theory of Liquidity Preference to manage crises
- **Controls**: Money supply changes, Bond purchases (QE), Crisis scenarios
- **Key Learning**: Money supply ‚Üí interest rates ‚Üí investment ‚Üí aggregate demand

## Educational Context

### Recommended Use
- **Economics Courses**: Principles, Intermediate Macro, Monetary Economics
- **History Classes**: 20th Century Economic History
- **Policy Studies**: Understanding real-world policy trade-offs
- **Self-Study**: Interactive way to learn economic concepts

### Learning Outcomes
After using this simulator, students should understand:
1. How macroeconomic policies interact and create trade-offs
2. Why certain historical policies succeeded or failed
3. The mathematical relationships underlying economic models
4. How expectations and credibility affect policy effectiveness
5. Modern challenges facing economic policymakers

## Historical Accuracy

The simulator uses real historical data and established economic theories:

### Data Sources
- **1920s**: Tax rates fell from ~75% to ~25%, money supply expanded ~60%
- **Great Depression**: GDP fell 27%, unemployment reached 25%, Smoot-Hawley affected thousands of products
- **1970s Oil Crisis**: Oil prices rose from $3.56 to $38/barrel, created stagflation
- **Modern Food Crisis**: Cocoa up 300%, vegetables up 80% (California drought), rice up 48% (Japan heatwave)

### Economic Models
- Phillips Curve with expectations adjustment
- Keynesian multiplier with crowding-out effects
- Liquidity preference theory for interest rate determination
- Open economy effects (impossible trinity)
